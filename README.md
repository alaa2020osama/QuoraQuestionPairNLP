# QuoraQuestionPairNLP
Quora Quetions here was used to train 4 models:
1. a pretrained BERT model (trainable LSTM layer added).
2. fine tuning on this BERT model --> validation accuracy: 93%
3. Naive Bayes model
   <br /> all of the above with illustration examples in the notebook for the tekonization and vectorization steps.
4. LSTM model was studied as well: https://www.kaggle.com/code/nkaps98/quora-question-pairs-glove-lstm/notebook
   <br />which used Glove in tekonization and vecorization: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/incorpes/glove6b200d
